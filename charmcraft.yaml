  open source terminal multiplexer, providing instant terminal sharing capabilities.

  Tmate is a terminal multiplexer that allows remote terminal sharing. It enables users to share
  their terminal session with other users over the internet, allowing them to collaborate, provide
  technical support, or demonstrate commands and procedures in real-time.

  This charm provides the tmate-ssh-server service, and when paired with the tmate client provides
  self-hosted ssh relay server.

  For DevOps and SRE teams, this charm will make operating self hosted tmate-ssh-server simple and
  straightforward through Juju's clean interface. Allowing machine relations to the
  [Github runner](https://charmhub.io/github-runner), it supports SSH debug access to the running
  machines.
